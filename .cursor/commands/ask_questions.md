Before proceeding, ask clarification questions about task to be performed. Do not proceed with any changes unless you get response to those clarifications. Be precise in those questions, point out gaps in description, suggest possible solutions to them. Format questions as a numbered points, and if there are subpoints - mark them with numbers as well (i.e. first level is 1., first subpoint to 1. is 1.1. etc.).
